# Experiments on Grokking: Generalization Beyond Overfitting

## Introduction

Some experiments implementing and extending the results in the paper
[*Grokking: Generalization Beyond Overfitting on Small Algorithmic
Datasets](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.02177.pdf) (Power et al., 2022).

## Getting started

This code doesn't require any special dependencies beyond TensorFlow and
NumPy. In particular, it should work out-of-the box on Colab or similarly
configured ML environment. If setting up from scratch, create a new
python virtual environment, and install NumPy and TensorFlow from pip. To
run the unit tests, you will also need to have PyTest installed.
